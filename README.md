# simpleSnakeGame
This is a simple snake game built from a tutorial to introduce myself to pygame. I will build on this simple game to enhance my learning. 

Currently, all the code has is logic for a snake, controlling it and feeding it to grow. The game has a default speed which means you get to play only one level. There is no game over as even if the snake goes out of bounds of the screen, you can get it back into the screen bounds by just going the opposite direction using your controls. You can see this happening in the video.
